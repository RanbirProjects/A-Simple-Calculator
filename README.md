Here is a **similar GitHub README** written for **your own JavaScript Calculator project**, written professionally so you can directly use it in your repository. You can replace the GitHub username and links if needed.

# JavaScript Calculator

A simple and responsive calculator built using **Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
This project demonstrates core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic arithmetic operations.

If you want, I can also make a **strong developer-level README** (with project structure, screenshots section, installation steps, and learning outcomes) — this looks very impressive to recruiters reviewing MERN portfolios.
